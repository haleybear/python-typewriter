In 2018 I learned several things:
It isn't selfish to say no.
Not everyone will behave or act the way you want them to. 
Accept that with love and compassion. 
In 2019 I will focus on:
Standing still and listening.
Owning only My emotions.
Your emotions - your joy, your sadness, your disappointment - are yours.
Not mine.

:)
